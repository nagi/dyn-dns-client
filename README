This is a update client for dyn.com / dyndns.org.

I knocked this little script up because I could get the feature-full but gargantuan 3000 line perl script they recommend to work.

curl & bash are required. It runs great on Ubuntu server 11.10, but YMMV.

Installation
------------
Chuck the script somewhere and cron it. I reckon running this as a daemon is added complexity for not much benefit, but you could do that too.
