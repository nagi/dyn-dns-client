Simple dyn.com dns client
=========================

About
-----
This is a update client for dyn.com / dyndns.org.

I knocked this little script up because I could get the feature-full but gargantuan 3000 line perl script they recommend to work.
curl & bash are required.

Recommended Installation
------------------------
- [ ] Place the script in /usr/local/bin
- [ ] Edit the variables at the top of the script.
- [ ] Ensure it is executable & call it from rc.local (/usr/local/bin/dyn-dns-client&)
- [ ] Don't forget the ampersand in the line  above!
